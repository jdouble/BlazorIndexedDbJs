# BlazorIndexedDbJs
This is a Blazor library for accessing IndexedDB and uses Jake Archibald's [idb library](https://github.com/jakearchibald/idb) for handling access to IndexedDB on the JavaScript side.

This version currently provides the following functionality:

* Open and upgrade an instance of IndexedDB, creating stores
* Append/Update/Delete single record
* Batch append/Update/Delete single record
* Retrieve all records from a given store
* Retrieve a record/or records from a store by index and value if the index exists
* Add a new store dynamically
* Works both with server-side Blazor and client-side Blazor

It does not, at the moment, support aggregate keys, searches using a range and some of the more obscure features of IndexedDB.


## Using the library

### requires 
NET 5.0 or newer

### 1. Install NuGet package

```
Install-Package BlazorIndexedDbJs
```

or

```
dotnet add package BlazorIndexedDbJs
```

### 2. Refence to indexedDb.Blazor.js library

For blazor wasm, in `wwwroot\index.html`
```html
...
<body>
    ...
    <script src="_framework/blazor.webassembly.js"></script>

    <!-- if you need to scan as soon as the app start, add this before _framework/blazor.webassembly.js -->
    <script src="_content/BlazorIndexedDbJs/indexedDb.Blazor.js"></script>
</body>
```

For blazor server, in `Pages/_Host.cshtml`
```html
...
<body>
    ...
    <script src="_framework/blazor.server.js"></script>    

    <!-- if you need to scan as soon as the app start, add this before _framework/blazor.server.js -->
    <script src="_content/BlazorIndexedDbJs/indexedDb.Blazor.js"></script>
</body>
```

### 3. create a database definition

```CSharp
    public class TheFactoryDb: IndexedDbDatabase
    {
        public const string Employees = "Employees";

        public override void OnConfiguring()
        {
            Name = "TheFactory";
            Version = 1;

            ObjectStores.Add(new IndexedDbObjectStore
            {
                Name = Employees,
                PrimaryKey = new IndexedDbIndex
                {
                    Name = "id",
                    KeyPath = "id",
                    Auto = true
                },
                Indexes = new List<IndexedDbIndex>
                {
                    new IndexedDbIndex
                    {
                        Name="firstName",
                        KeyPath = "firstName",
                        Auto=false
                    },
                    new IndexedDbIndex
                    {
                        Name="lastName",
                        KeyPath = "lastName",
                        Auto=false
                    }
                }
            });
        }
    }
```

#### Step 1 - define the database
To define the database we need to first give it a name and set its version. IndexedDB uses the version to determine whether it needs to update the database. For example if you decide to add a new store then increment the version to ensure that the store is added to the database.

#### Step 2 - Add a store(table) to the database
In IndexedDB a ObjectStore is equivalent to table. To create an ObjectStore we create a new ```IndexedDbObjectStore``` and add it to the collection of ObjectStores.

Within the ```ObjectStore``` we define the name, the primary index key and optionally a set of foreign key indexes if required.

The ```IndexedDbIndex``` is used to define the primary key and any foreign keys that are required. It has the following properties:

* Name - the name of the index
* KeyPath - the identifier for the property in the saved object/record that is to be indexed
* Unique - defines whether the key value must be unique
* Auto - determines whether the index value should be generated by IndexedDB.

In the example above for the "Employees" store the primary key is explicitly set to the keypath "id" and we want it automatically generated by IndexedDB. In the "Outbox" store the primary key just has ```Auto = true``` set. IndexedDB is left to handle the rest.


### 4. add scoped service for database

For blazor wasm, in `startup.cs`
```CSharp
    public class Program
    {
        public static async Task Main(string[] args)
        {
            var builder = WebAssemblyHostBuilder.CreateDefault(args);
            builder.RootComponents.Add<App>("#app");

            builder.Services.AddScoped(sp => new HttpClient { BaseAddress = new Uri(builder.HostEnvironment.BaseAddress) });

            builder.Services.AddScoped<IndexedDbManager<TheFactoryDb>>();

            await builder.Build().RunAsync();
        }
    }
```

For blazor server, in `program.cs`
```CSharp
        public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
        {
            services.AddRazorPages();
            services.AddServerSideBlazor();
            services.AddSingleton<WeatherForecastService>();

            services.AddScoped<IndexedDbManager<TheFactoryDb>>();
        }
```


## Using IndexedDbManager

For the following examples we are going to assume that we have Person class which is defined as follows:

```CSharp
 public class Person
    {
        public long? Id { get; set; }
        public string FirstName { get; set; }
        public string LastName { get; set; }

    }
```
And the data store name is "Employees"


### Accessing IndexedDBManager

To use IndexedDB in a component or page first inject the IndexedDbManager instance.

```CSharp
@inject IndexedDBManager<TheFactoryDb> theFactoryDb
```

### Setting up notifications

IndexedDBManager exposes ```ActionCompleted``` event that is raised when an action is completed.

If you want to receive notifications in the ```OnInit()`` function subscribe to the event.

The function that handles the event should have the following signature:

```CSharp
 private void OnIndexedDbNotification(object sender, IndexedDBNotificationArgs args)
    {
        Message = args.Message;
    }
```

It is recommended that your page or component should also implement IDisposable to unsubscribe from the event.

### Adding a record to an IndexedDb store

Assuming we have a new instance of our sample ```Person``` class, to add to the "Employees" store doing the following:

```CSharp
await theFactoryDb.AddRecord("Employees", NewPerson);
```

### Getting all records from a store

```CSharp
var people = await theFactoryDb.GetRecords<Person>("Employees");
```
 
### Get record by Id
To get a record using the id can be done as follows:

```CSharp
var person = await theFactoryDb.GetRecordById<long, Person>("Employees", id);
```

### getting a record using the index

To find a record using an index

```CSharp
var person = await theFactoryDb.GetRecordByIndex<string, Person>("Employees", "firstName", "John");
```

By default IndexedDB only returns the first record found that matches the query. If you want to get all of the records that match the query value use the following:

```CSharp
var people = await theFactoryDb.GetRecordByIndex<string, Person>("Employees", "firstName", "John");
```

### Updating a record

```
await theFactoryDb.UpdateRecord<Person>("Employees", recordToUpdate)
```

### Deleting a record

```
await theFactoryDb.UpdateRecord<int>("Employees", id)
```

### Clear all records from a store

```
await theFactoryDb.ClearStore("Employees")
```

### Deleting a Database

```
await theFactoryDb.DeleteDb()
```

### Adding a new store dynamically

If you have occasion to what to add a store when the program is up and running. The following

```CSharp
var newObjectStore = new IndexedDbObjectStore
    {
        Name = NewStoreName,
        PrimaryKey = new IndexedDbIndex { Name = "id", KeyPath = "id", Auto = true },
    };

await theFactoryDb.AddNewStore(newObjectStore);
```

What this will do is, if the store doesn't already exist, is increment the database version number and add the store to the database.
